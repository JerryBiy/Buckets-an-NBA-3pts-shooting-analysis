# Buckets-an-NBA-3pts-shooting-analysis
The 3-point shot is an irreplaceable element of modern basketball and has transformed how the game is played. Nowadays, NBA teams are shooting more 3-pointers than ever before. This project will detail the story of how teams have become increasingly reliant on 3-point shots. We’ll analyze data trends that showcase the increasing frequency of 3 point attempts and how this correlates with offensive strategies and overall team performance. We’ll leverage the data visualization tools we gained from the course to tell the narrative of the rise of this iconic element and offer insight into the connection between 3-point shots and performance metrics.
